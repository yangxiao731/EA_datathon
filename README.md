# EA_datathon
The goal of the datathon (hosted by Wharton and sponsored by Electronic Atrs a.k.a EA) is to improve the recommendation system. We explored feature engineering extra variables to describe the perception of games from public sources of data (ratings and reviews we scraped from Amazon.com) and modeled the change of perceptions of games over time, before and after launch.
